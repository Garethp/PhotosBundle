Gareth's Photos Bundle
==============

**This is very early in development**

Okay, so the story thus far is that I'm keen to try and get into OpenSource, but whenever I think about it I never have anything I deem worthy or ready yet. So for this bundle, I'm just putting it out there. It's not polished, it's not clean, it's not even nice at the moment. I'ts about as barebones as it gets. It's a simple bundle for uploading photos. The reason I chose this to make Open Source is frankly that it can upload photos from your phone while you're offline. The photos will be stored on your device using the FileSystemAPI in JS, and then upload it to the site when you're connected. The JS will be it's own project, but it's tied in to this bundle. Enough rambling. In short, don't use this yet. Don't even think about it. It's not ready, and I'm just doing this for the heck of it
